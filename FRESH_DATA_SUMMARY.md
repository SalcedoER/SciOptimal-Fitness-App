# SciOptimal Fresh Data Generation System

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
Every new user account now gets **completely fresh, personalized data** calculated based on their profile information. No more generic templates - everything is tailored to the individual user.

## ðŸ”„ What Happens When a User Registers

### 1. **Profile Analysis**
- Age, height, weight, body fat percentage
- Activity level and equipment availability
- Target physique goals (lean recomp, muscle gain, final cut)
- Sleep schedule preferences

### 2. **Automatic Data Generation**
- **Training Phase**: Personalized workout plan with exercises matching their equipment
- **Nutrition Plan**: Calculated macros based on their TDEE and goals
- **Progress Baseline**: Initial measurements and strength estimates
- **Sleep Baseline**: Age-appropriate sleep recommendations

### 3. **Real-Time Calculations**
- BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) using Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
- TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) with activity multipliers
- Macro targets optimized for their specific goals
- Training frequency based on experience level

## ðŸ“Š Fresh Data Examples

### TestUser Profile (Lean Recomp)
```json
{
  "age": 25,
  "height": 70, // 5'10"
  "weight": 80, // 176 lbs
  "bodyFatPercentage": 15,
  "targetPhysique": "lean_recomp",
  "activityLevel": "moderately_active"
}
```

**Generated Data:**
- **BMR**: 1,847 calories
- **TDEE**: 2,863 calories
- **Macros**: 211g protein, 179g carbs, 80g fat, 88g fiber
- **Training**: 4 days/week with bodyweight + equipment exercises
- **Cardio**: 2x/week, 20 minutes, low intensity

### Devin's Profile (Muscle Gain)
```json
{
  "age": 28,
  "height": 72, // 6'0"
  "weight": 85, // 187 lbs
  "bodyFatPercentage": 18,
  "targetPhysique": "muscle_gain",
  "activityLevel": "very_active"
}
```

**Generated Data:**
- **BMR**: 1,987 calories
- **TDEE**: 3,428 calories
- **Target Calories**: 3,771 calories (10% surplus)
- **Macros**: 187g protein, 471g carbs, 84g fat, 94g fiber
- **Training**: 5 days/week with gym equipment focus
- **Cardio**: 2x/week, 20 minutes, low intensity

## ðŸ§® Calculation Methods

### BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)
```
Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
BMR = 10 Ã— weight(kg) + 6.25 Ã— height(cm) - 5 Ã— age + 5 (male) or -161 (female)
```

### TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
```
Activity Multipliers:
- Sedentary: 1.2
- Lightly Active: 1.375
- Moderately Active: 1.55
- Very Active: 1.725
- Extremely Active: 1.9
```

### Macro Calculations
```
Protein: 1.0-1.4g per lb bodyweight (goal-dependent)
Fat: 20-30% of total calories (goal-dependent)
Carbs: Remaining calories after protein and fat
Fiber: 0.5g per lb bodyweight (minimum 25g)
```

### Training Frequency
```
- Beginner/Moderate: 4 days/week
- Advanced: 5 days/week
- Rest days calculated automatically
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Exercise Generation

### Equipment-Based Selection
- **Bodyweight Only**: Push-ups, squats, planks, etc.
- **Dumbbells**: Presses, rows, curls, lunges
- **Pull-up Bar**: Pull-ups, chin-ups, leg raises
- **Resistance Bands**: Band rows, band presses, band squats
- **Gym Membership**: Full range of compound movements

### Goal-Optimized Rep Ranges
- **Muscle Gain**: 8-12 reps (hypertrophy focus)
- **Lean Recomp**: 6-10 reps (strength + hypertrophy)
- **Final Cut**: 6-10 reps (strength maintenance)

### Progressive Overload Rules
- **Strength**: Increase weight by 5-10 lbs when 2+ reps in reserve
- **Hypertrophy**: Increase weight by 2.5-5 lbs when 1+ rep in reserve
- **Endurance**: Increase reps by 1-2 when 0 reps in reserve

## ðŸ’§ Sleep & Recovery

### Age-Based Recommendations
- **Under 18**: 9 hours (growth and development)
- **18-65**: 8 hours (optimal recovery)
- **Over 65**: 7 hours (adequate recovery)

### Stress & Caffeine Tracking
- Stress levels: 1-10 scale
- Caffeine intake: Hours before bedtime
- Sleep quality: 1-10 scale with notes

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

### Initial Measurements
- **Proportional to height** for realistic starting points
- **Strength estimates** based on lean mass and experience level
- **Conservative estimates** for new users (80% of typical)

### Strength Baselines
```
Bench Press: 0.8 Ã— lean mass Ã— experience multiplier
Squat: 1.2 Ã— lean mass Ã— experience multiplier
Deadlift: 1.5 Ã— lean mass Ã— experience multiplier
Overhead Press: 0.5 Ã— lean mass Ã— experience multiplier
Rows: 0.7 Ã— lean mass Ã— experience multiplier
```

## ðŸ”„ Data Refresh Options
